Crawl: Dungeon Stone Soup: The Pen and Paper Game

The Idea
========

Crawl is a great game. Pen and Paper games are fun. What if we could combine the two?

The idea is to have a roguelike dungeon that is crawled by a team of people, who are opposed by the RNG (a.k.a. Game Master). They need to collect enough runes to find the Orb of Zot, and work together to save the world!

Some bullshit ideas:

- Character death becomes party death--as long as one member of the party is alive, someone is alive. This means there will have to be a way to bring players back into the game. It wouldn't be very roguelike if the old characters were just resurrected--some other mechanic will have to replace that old D&D standby.
- Random generation of maps, loot, etc
